# MIPSim: MIPS Processor VHDL Simulation

MIPSim is a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor simulation project designed in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). This project aims to provide a detailed implementation of the MIPS processor.

## Features

* Complete simulation of a 32-bit MIPS processor.
* Support for essential MIPS instructions for computation and flow control.
* Modular architecture for easy understanding and extension.
* Testbenches included for functionality validation.

## Prerequisites

* A VHDL environment (e.g., GHDL, ModelSim).
* A text editor or IDE supporting VHDL.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, whether they are extensions, bug fixes, or improved documentation.
