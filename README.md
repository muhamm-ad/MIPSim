# MIPSim: MIPS Processor VHDL Simulation

MIPSim is a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor simulation project designed in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). This project aims to provide a detailed implementation of the MIPS processor.

## Features

* Complete simulation of a 32-bit MIPS processor.
* Support for essential MIPS instructions for computation and flow control.
* Modular architecture for easy understanding and extension.
* Testbenches included for functionality validation.

## Prerequisites

* A VHDL environment (e.g., GHDL, ModelSim).
* A text editor or IDE supporting VHDL.

<!-- ## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/MIPSim.git`
2. Open the project folder in your VHDL environment.
3. Compile and run the VHDL files according to your environment's instructions.

## Usage

To run the MIPS simulation:

1. Load the main VHDL file into your simulator.
2. Execute the simulation using the provided testbenches.
3. Analyze the results and outputs of the simulator to understand the behavior of the MIPS processor. -->
